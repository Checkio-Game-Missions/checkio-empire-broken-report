Ingots in each consignment are numbered in the row from A1 to Z9 as
A1, A2,..., A9, B1, B2, ..., Z9. Each consignment are marked by the last ingots in it.
So you can define the quantity of ingots my marks.

Daily report is broken. All commas in this were removed or replaced with a junk.
We should find a good marks in the report. Each mark should be looked as "LD", where
"L" is a capital latin letter and "D" is a digit from 1 to 9 (zero is wrong).

You are given a report as a text. Find all consignment marks and count the total quantity of ingots.
For example, "ASDA1,BB22D01C1" -- here we can find three marks: A1, B2 and C1, so the result is 31.


This is a code golf mission and you code should be as short as possible.
The shorter code will give you more points.
The lowest edge of the code length is 200 symbols.
